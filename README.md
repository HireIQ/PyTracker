Python APIs for Pivotal Tracker
===============================

*NOTE: As of Jan 27, 2012, [Pivotal has turned off their v2 API](http://pivotallabs.com/users/dan/blog/articles/1975-pivotal-tracker-api-v2-to-be-removed-on-jan-27) which is what this used. That means there isn't a lot you can do with this library anymore.*

This is a clone of [The Pytracker Mercurial Repository](http://code.google.com/p/pytracker/) with added support for setup tools.

For information on how to use pytracker or for copyright information, see the original Google Code repository.
